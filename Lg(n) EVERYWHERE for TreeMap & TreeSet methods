TreeMap time complexity : Provides natural sorting of elements. Uses equals, compare and compareTo methods 
to determine the sorting order.
Read/Search any element O(log n)
Update : O(log n)
Delete : O(log n)
Add : O(log n)

TreeSet time complexity : Internally used an instances of TreeMap with the elements as key and a dummy value
for all entries in the TreeMap.
Read/Search any element O(log n)
Update : O(log n)
Delete : O(log n)
Add : O(log n)
